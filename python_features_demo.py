# 1. Variables
# Variables are used to store data in memory
# Variables can be of any type
# Variables can be assigned to other variables
# Variables can be reassigned to other values
# Variables can be reassigned to other types

# 2. Data types
# Python has several built-in data types
# int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict, set, frozenset, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, complex, range, None
# We can check the type of a variable using the type() function
# We can convert between types using the int(), float(), str(), bool(), list(), tuple(), dict(), set(), frozenset(), bytes(), bytearray(), memoryview(), complex(), range(), None() functions

# 3. Operators
# Python has several built-in operators
# Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
# Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=
# Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# Logical operators: and, or, not
# Identity operators: is, is not
# Membership operators: in, not in
# Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

# 4. Control structures
# Python has several built-in control structures
# if, elif, else
# for, while
# break, continue, pass

# 5. Functions
# Functions are used to group code that performs a specific task
# Functions can be called from other functions
# Functions can be called from other files
# Functions can be passed arguments
# Functions can return values

# 6. Classes
# Classes are used to group data and functions that perform a specific task
# Classes can be instantiated
# Classes can be inherited
# Classes can be passed arguments
# Classes can return values

# 7. Modules
# Modules are used to group code that performs a specific task
# Modules can be imported into other modules
# Modules can be imported into other files
# Modules can be passed arguments
# Modules can return values

# 8. Packages
# Packages are used to group modules that perform a specific task
# Packages can be imported into other modules
# Packages can be imported into other files
# Packages can be passed arguments
# Packages can return values

# 9. Exceptions
# Exceptions are used to handle errors
# Exceptions can be raised
# Exceptions can be caught
# Exceptions can be handled

# 10. File handling
# Files are used to store data on disk
# Files can be opened
# Files can be read
# Files can be written
# Files can be closed

# 11. Regular expressions
# Regular expressions are used to match patterns in strings
# Regular expressions can be compiled
# Regular expressions can be matched
# Regular expressions can be searched
# Regular expressions can be replaced

# 12. JSON
# JSON is used to store data in a human-readable format
# JSON can be encoded
# JSON can be decoded

# 13. Date and time
# Date and time are used to store dates and times
# Date and time can be formatted
# Date and time can be parsed

# 14. Math
# Math is used to perform mathematical operations
# Math can be used to calculate the absolute value
# Math can be used to calculate the ceiling
# Math can be used to calculate the floor
# Math can be used to calculate the factorial
# Math can be used to calculate the greatest common divisor
# Math can be used to calculate the least common multiple
# Math can be used to calculate the logarithm
# Math can be used to calculate the power
# Math can be used to calculate the square root
# Math can be used to calculate the trigonometric functions

# 15. Random
# Random is used to generate random numbers
# Random can be used to generate random numbers

# 16. Statistics
# Statistics is used to perform statistical operations
# Statistics can be used to calculate the mean
# Statistics can be used to calculate the median
# Statistics can be used to calculate the mode
# Statistics can be used to calculate the standard deviation
# Statistics can be used to calculate the variance

# 17. Collections
# Collections are used to store collections of data
# Collections can be used to store collections of data

# 18. Itertools
# Itertools are used to iterate over collections of data
# Itertools can be used to iterate over collections of data

# 19. Threading
# Threading is used to run multiple threads of execution
# Threading can be used to run multiple threads of execution

# 20. Multiprocessing
# Multiprocessing is used to run multiple processes
# Multiprocessing can be used to run multiple processes
